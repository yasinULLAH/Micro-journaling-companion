# Micro-Journaling Companion

The **Micro-Journaling Companion** is a minimalist journaling app that allows users to record one-sentence daily entries. With a simple interface and intuitive design, this app encourages daily reflection through micro-journal entries. Over time, users can view their journal entries in a timeline and calendar format, and even export their entries as a text file.

- **Interactive Entries**: Click on any day in the calendar to view, edit, or add a journal entry for that day.
- **Export Entries**: Users can export all their journal entries as a `.txt` file for personal reflection or archival.
